# DEV IMAGES

This Chrome extension streamlines web development by replacing image URLs in sandbox environments with those specific to development. This eliminates the need to download all static resources for proper sandbox functionality, optimizing the development process. The extension facilitates a seamless transition between local and development images, enhancing workflow efficiency.

## Installing

-  Check if your `Node.js` version is >= **14**.
-  Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
-  In the package.json you can change the some configurations
```shell
  "sites": {
    "kiwokoES": "development.kiwoko.com",
    "kiwokoPT": "development.kiwoko.pt",

## Special thanks

Agus ðŸ¤Ž for bringing forth this idea!


Now, the content of `build` folder will be the extension ready to be submitted to the Chrome Web Store. Just take a look at the [official guide](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) to more infos about publishing.
